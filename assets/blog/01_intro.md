Hi!

My name is Eri and I’m passionate about programming and free software. I’m from Galicia, a small coastal state in northern Spain and I’m currently finishing a Computer Science degree. I’m also proudly non binary and I use they/them pronouns.

This blog will tell my journey as an Outreachy open source intern working on [Servo](CITATION), a very cool next generation, modular, embeddable and memory safe web engine written in Rust. This is my first time working on anything like this. I’m certain that I’m going to learn so much and I can’t wait to share it with you.

## Core values

**Community** is essential to me. We are nothing without eachother, a fact that open source projects beautifully represent. They are built by different people coming together to create something they are passionate about, which brings so much good to everyone. Community has so many definitions, each of them beautiful. There is community in the found family you create with your loved ones, in the interactions with your neighbours, in the feeling of belonging. The Outreachy and Servo communities where nothing but welcoming and supportive, they are a place where one wants to be, in which to learn and grow.

Despite the importance of coming together, we should not forget about our own **Identity**. It can be complex to think about, difficult to come to terms with, and even frustrating and alienating at times. However, it is also your biggest source of power, it is what makes you _you_. If it weren't for it, I probably would be on a very different place, and I like who I ended up growing into. The sum of everyones collective experiences and identities makes a community strong and resilient. Projects like these couldn't be if not for everyone contributing a bit of themselves.

This circle closes like a warm embrace with **Openness**. To be able to make any meaningful progress the input and knowledge of your peers is your biggest tool, should you be open to receive it. An open community, one that fosters collaboration and acceptance, is the best place to grow. Besides this, I believe _open_ code contributes to create a fairer world. By not imposing arbitrary barriers of entrance or only serving to the interests of a few, everyone can benefit from your work. I truly believe in code that is free, both free as in free beer and free as in freedom.

## Outreachy

This year's [XDC](CITATION) changed the course of my carreer. I was so lucky that it happened in my hometown and that by chance I decided to go to see what it was about. My passion for open source code comes from long ago, but I didn't really see it as something I could actually work on before. Meeting so many amazing and welcoming people with incredible projects made me realize I wanted to be a part of this **community**.

I first learned about Outreachy when I was researching possible opportunities for this summer. I looked into some projects but Outreachy caught my eye. Something about the values and format of the experience deeply agreed with me. Since there was not much to lose, I decided to give it a try.

The contribution period was awesome. Even if I used open source code for years, I always felt like I wasn't good enough to contribute yet. Before March I had only made a few tiny prs to some projects I was using ([bevy](CITATION) and [swayfx](CITATION)), but all changed then. The mentors along with the entire Servo community were so nice and they really motivated me to take a leap of faith and give my best. I really enjoyed the work I did, even the smaller cleaning tasks felt great because there was purpose and belonging in them.

When I got accepted.

I made some good friends.
