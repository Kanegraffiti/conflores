Hi!

My name is Eri and I’m passionate about programming and free software. I’m from Galicia, a small coastal state in northern Spain and I’m currently finishing a Computer Science degree. I’m proudly non binary and I use they/them pronouns.

This blog will tell my journey as an Outreachy open source intern working on Servo, a very cool next generation, modular, embeddable and memory safe web engine written in Rust. This is my first time working on anything like this. I’m certain that I’m going to learn so much and I can’t wait to share it with you.

## Core values

Without a doubt the first core value I have to choose is **community**. We are nothing without eachother, and I think that open source projects are a beautiful representation of this. They are built by people coming together to create something they are passionate about, and they bring so much good to everyone.

Also friends etc

**Identity**

**Openness**

Free as in free beer and free as in freedom.
